In this project, we explore and implement various Data Structures in a functional programming paradigm. 

Functional Data Structures prioritize immutability, ensuring that every operation on a structure creates a new structure without modifying the original. This approach eliminates side effects and makes the program easier to debug, reason about, and test.

This project include 4 Data Structures : 
- Stack and Queue
- Linked List
- Tree
- Graph

Each structure is implemented in its own folder. So, you will find 4 folders, one for each of the structures mentionned

For each structure, we have mainly 3 files : 
- 1 Haskell Functional Programming File
- 1 Cpp Functional Programming File
- 1 Cpp OOP Implementation File

Kindly, you will have to install and open documentation files attached with the strcutures, where we explain the program with some comparisions

Thank you
